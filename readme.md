# Cloud Consultant (Azure)

Cloud consultant with **3 years of experience** supporting **large-scale Azure migrations** end-to-end—discovery and readiness through cutover execution. I also build **Python scripts** to automate reporting, clean inventory data, and reduce repetitive coordination work. Recently, I’ve been exploring **AI tools** (including local deployments) to accelerate documentation, analysis, and delivery workflows.

- **Cutover-critical infrastructure:** VLAN/gateway cutovers, routing validation, connectivity verification, and rapid issue triage during bridges  
- **Operational enablement:** runbooks, SOPs, onboarding guides, monitoring/readiness checklists, and clean handoffs to operations  
- **Program coordination:** aligning engineering, PMO, infrastructure, app owners, and vendors across time zones with clear status + accountability  
- **Reporting & tracking:** building durable tracking mechanisms, dashboards, and executive summaries to improve data quality and decision-making  
- **Python scripting & automation:** building small tools to parse/clean exports (CSV/RVTools), validate inventories, automate status reporting, and reduce repetitive coordination work
